@autowired - autowire by type first - works if there is exactly one bean of
that type.

@resource - like autowire but match by beanName not type 

@componentScan - scan for classes down from basepackeges

All spring managed beans are singletons by default

@Scope - (prototype) -> makes bean not singleton
@Scope(singleton) - default
@Scope(prototype) -> normal
@Scope(request, session) - >?

factory-method - xml when factory(abstract class)
Can get factory from instanceMethod and then another factory from that factory name and its method
